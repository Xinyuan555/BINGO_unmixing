# BINGO_unmixing
#	Minimum requirements of the code
#	To run this code, MATLAB(Mathworks) should be installed. In addition, MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox is required to run unmixing code.
#	We have tested the code with MATLAB R2021a running on Windows 10
#	Demo image
# A demo input image is in the ‘DEMO/BEADS/raw’ folder.
#	The demo input image was required by Zeiss LSM 780, which equipped with Mai Tai HP (690nm-850nm) laser, W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0w objective, and 32-array GaAsP detector. The spectral imaging was set to 16 channels with a bandwidth of 17.9 nm per unit and a detec-tion range of 410-695 nm. 
#	15-μm diameter polystyrene fluorescent beads（F8837 Blue，F8838 Blue-green, F21010 Geen, F8844 Yellow-green, F21011 Yellow, F8841 Orange, F21012 Red-orange, F8842 Red, F8839, Crimson, F8843 Scarlet, Thermo Fisher, Scientific）were embedded in confocal imaging dishes with agarose.
#	Simply running the code (‘BINGO_Main_beads.m’) will genetate unmixed images, in the ‘DEMO/BEADS/Results’ folder.
